# wine_quality
This is project which specifically predicts the quality of the wine based on varius features like-
fixed acidity           
volatile acidity        
citric acid             
residual sugar          
chlorides               
free sulfur dioxide     
total sulfur dioxide    
density                 
pH                      
sulphates               
alcohol                 
On calculating the features mentioned we are predictiong teh quality ranging from 1-10.
We have carried out the data set of 1143 records and implemented linear regreesion model a kind of supervised machine learning model in order to improvise the given dataset.
